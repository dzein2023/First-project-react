  <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
  <p>We are the center of the green city located in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in Jerusalem. 
    This place is dedicated to providing urban agricultural services and educating and empowering local communities. 
    Our goal is to address the urban environment in Jerusalem by providing local and sustainable solutions, 
    through the centerâ€™s specialized team and in cooperation with external institutions related to this field. 
    The idea of establishing this center came from the presence of unused spaces in the Jerusalem area. 
    This idea began when a community garden was created around the city library about three years ago. Next, 
    we needed pilot projects to prove to society that it is indeed possible to grow indoors and start changing our environment. 
    In simple steps. Hence the idea of exploiting empty building roofs and turning them into green roofs.</p>

  <h1>Our Mission</h1>
  <p>Our mission at the center focuses on several main axes, 
    namely educating and educating the community, as well as following a multi-dimensional approach
     to include addressing the city, community work, urban planning,
      economic empowerment, sustainability, and the environment.</p>

  <h1>Our Vision</h1>
  <p>Making the city of Jerusalem green and with a better and more beautiful environment</p>
